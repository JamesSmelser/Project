# Project Step 2
The goal for my project is to develop a GUI phone application. The function
of the application will be to have the capability to allow the user to either
manually input or take a picture of an items barcode. The application will
then read and return consumer ratings and feedback for that item. This will
allow buyers to review feedback on an item before buying in a quick and
efficient manner.

The data requirements for this project include the following. First the type
of phone system (iphone, android) will be identified. Second it will require
input and data from the Amazon's product advertising API. Lastly it will need user data
for the item to be searched and saved data from previous searches.

The programming requirements are in three parts. One it will require the
identification through typing or photo recognition of the items barcode.
Two the application will have to take the barcode data and link it to the
amazon store and return the consumer information for that item. Last it will
need to save previous item searches for comparison.

The user interface will consist of a GUI with a text block for the barcode
number and a button for access to the phones camera in order to take a
picture of the barcode. The GUI will also include a drop down menu of previously
searched items for the consumer to review and compare.

In conclusion my project will allow the user an efficient and manageable way to
shop for items, allowing the user to make smart buying decisions through consumer
ratings. It will allow the user to compare like items and select the best item.
This will allow the consumer an easy cost efficient way to shop and save money
while not wasting time searching through the internet for an items rating/feedback.
